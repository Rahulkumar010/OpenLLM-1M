🎨 Logo Design Concept for OpenLLM-1M
Style:
Minimalist tech with a clean, modern vector look.

Slightly futuristic but still dev-oriented.

Monochrome or dual-color for simplicity (can work in dark/light modes).

🧩 Logo Elements to Combine:
Brain or Circuit Brain 🧠

Represents intelligence, language model, and neural networks.

Can have subtle circuit lines to show it's tech-powered.

Token Stream / Waveform 🌊

Use a flowing wave of squares or binary-like dots moving through the brain or CPU.

Represents the massive token flow – 1M scale.

CPU Symbol / Chip Outline 🧾

Integrate a CPU chip in the background or as part of the brain.

Reinforces that this can run locally, no GPU needed.

“1M” Mark 🔢

Include 1M subtly or boldly in the design — maybe embedded within the chip or beside the brain like a badge.

Open Source Hint (Optional) 🔓

A small open lock icon or broken chain link for that “open” ethos.

💡 Example Concepts (visual description):
Brain inside a chip, with a wave of small squares (tokens) flowing through it, and a clean “1M” label in the corner.

A stylized CPU icon with neural net lines forming a brain on top, and “OpenLLM-1M” written in a futuristic sans-serif font below.

Minimal logo: A rounded-square CPU chip icon with a small brain and the number "1M" in one quadrant, simple and scalable.
